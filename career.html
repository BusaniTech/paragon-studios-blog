	<div class="mt-3">
    In this fast-paced and continuously evolving world of software engineering, every day presents a unique set of challenges and creativity for 
    software engineers to improve themselves and learn daily. A typical day in the life of a software engineer starts with prioritizing todayâ€™s work 
    and meeting with the team regarding the progress of the current feature of the project. Each day has a different way of working but has some 
    tasks in common if we generalize, meeting with the product manager and collaborating with the different teams like DevOps and UI/UX teams, bug  
    fixing, and writing code for new features. Also, sometimes you have to maintain the already deployed product.</div>
