    Soweto, urban complex in Gauteng province, South Africa. Originally set aside by the South African white government for residence by Blacks, 
	it adjoins the city of Johannesburg on the southwest; it's name is an acronym derived from South-Western Townships. Most people only know a
	handful of facts about the township, it is a vibrant township located at the edge of Joburg, and it was the site of a student uprising in 1976 
    that helped to bring international attention to the struggle against the old regime. But there’s so much more to know — Soweto has a fascinating
	history and is home to a diverse array of people from all walks of life.
	
	Soweto is credited as one of the founding places for Kwaito and Kasi Rap, which is a style of hip hop specific to South Africa? Known for it's 
	vibrant nightlife, the area is the uncrowned party capital of South Africa. But the bus does not stop there – not by a long shot. The region is 
	also filled with family entertainment, such as movie complexes, picnic spots and so on. No matter what type of fun you’re looking for you are 
	sure to find it here. In 2010, South Africa hosted the FIFA World Cup and with that, the township saw the revitalisation of it's soccer stadiums
	and infrastructure as well as the construction of Soccer City in Nasrec. The area is also rich in sports fields and clinics, such as the 
	Nike Football Training Centre in Klipspruit.
