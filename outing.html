	<div class="mt-3">
    Since the beginning of time, food has been a key ingredient in our social and cultural lives. Across all societies, shared meals and feasts have 
	brought families, friends, and neighbours together in celebration of food. It’s no wonder why every party, wedding or graduation is accompanied 
	by platters of delicious food—it’s the binding agent that brings us together. Why should the office be any different? In a team-based work 
	environment, success often depends on the ability of the company to create a strong, cohesive community culture.

    Countless studies have found that shared meals and eating together are beneficial for mental health and worker productivity.
    When we eat together and increase the amount of face time spent between colleagues, we build trust and mutual respect between both parties. 
    The outcome is better behaviour and performance, improved teamwork and collaboration, elevated employee engagement, greater sense of belonging 
    and inclusivity.
